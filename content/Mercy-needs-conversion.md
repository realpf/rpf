<blockquote>
[...] the Lord indicates the fundamental content of the preaching that they must
offer the world. We can synthesize it in two words: “conversion” and
“forgiveness of sins”. These are the two qualifying aspects of the mercy of God
who lovingly cares for us. Today let us take into consideration conversion.

What is conversion? It is present throughout the Bible, and particularly in the
preaching of the prophets, who continually urge the people to “return to the
Lord” by asking him for forgiveness and changing their ways. Conversion,
according to the prophets, means changing direction and turning to the Lord
anew, relying on the certainty that He loves us and his love is ever steadfast.
Returning to the Lord.  [...]
